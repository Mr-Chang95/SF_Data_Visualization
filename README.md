# San Francisco Business Data Analysis And Visualization
## by Daniel Chang

## Project Description
For this project, I am interested in analyzing businesses that have physical locations in the Bay Area. Mainly, those located in San Francisco. I am going to put a lot of focus on the industries of these businesses. For somewhere like SF, my initial thought was that the most popular industry would be financial services. I will then examine the locations of these businesses and industries. Perhaps, each area has a higher concentration of a particular industry than another. 

## Dataset
This dataset contains 28,3369 loans with 32 variables for each business, including 'City', 'Source Zipcode', 'Location Start Date','Location End Date', 'NAICS Code Description', 'Neighborhoods - Analysis Boundaries'.


## Summary of Findings
During my project, I found that the most popular industry in SF/Bay Area is real estate, rental & leasing services, then the professional, scientific and technical services. The most popular zip code is 94110, while the most popular boundary is the Financial District/South Beach. In most zip codes and boundaries, the real estate, rental & leasing industry is the most dominant. We also found that the most businesses (active) opened their location in the 1990s.
