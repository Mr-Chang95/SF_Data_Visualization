## Dataset
This dataset contains 28,3369 loans with 32 variables on each business, including 'City', 'Source Zipcode', 'Location Start Date','Location End Date', 'NAICS Code Description', 'Neighborhoods - Analysis Boundaries'.


## Summary of Findings
During my project, I found that the most popular industry in SF/Bay Area is real estate, rental & leasing services then the professional, scientific and technical services. The most popular zip code is 94110 while the most popular boundary is the Financial District/South Beach. In most zip code and boundaries the real estate, rental & leasing industry is the most dominate. We also found that the most businesses (active) opened their location in the 1990s.
